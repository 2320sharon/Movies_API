# Movies_API
This API was developed with Node.JS and utilizes AXIOS to make calls to a movies database api via a url. It also updates and access a local MySQL database based on the axios calls. It parses JSON responses from the Axios API calls into a format that can be stored in the MYSQL database via a prepared statement for added database security. 

This is a copy of a group project that was done for my CSC 131 Software Enginneering class. At the time of this project we had no taken any databases classes, hence why the calls the local copy of the mySQL database do not function properly as we did not know how to host databases to the cloud yet.
