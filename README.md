# Movies_API
This API was developed with Node.JS and utilizes AXIOS to make calls to a movies database api via a url. It also updates and access a local MySQL database based on the axios calls. It parses JSON responses from the Axios API calls into a format that can be stored in the MYSQL database via a prepared statement for added database security.
